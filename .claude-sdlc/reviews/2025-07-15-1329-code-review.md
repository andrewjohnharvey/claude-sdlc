# Code Review Report: install.sh Update Safety Analysis

**Date:** July 15, 2025, 1:29 PM  
**Scope:** install.sh script update mechanism and file preservation  
**Focus:** Update safety, file preservation, directory structure management  
**Reviewer:** Claude Code

## Executive Summary

The install.sh script generally preserves user data effectively during updates but has several **critical security vulnerabilities** and **medium-risk operational issues** that should be addressed before production use. The file preservation mechanism works correctly for user data, but configuration files and custom commands face overwrite risks.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ **User data preservation**: Excellent (all work products are preserved)
- ⚠️ **Configuration safety**: Moderate risk (MCP configs overwritten)  
- ❌ **Security vulnerabilities**: Critical issues found (code injection, race conditions)
- ⚠️ **Update robustness**: Needs improvement (error handling, cleanup)
- ⚠️ **Directory extensibility**: Limited scalability for future growth

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Code Injection Vulnerability - **CRITICAL**
**File:** `install.sh:69`  
**Issue:** Use of `eval "$@"` enables command injection attacks
```bash
execute() {
  if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == false ]]; then
    eval "$@"  # DANGEROUS - allows code injection
  fi
}
```
**Impact:** Malicious command execution through crafted inputs  
**Fix:** Replace with direct command execution: `"$@"`

### 2. Race Condition in Temporary Directory Creation - **HIGH**
**File:** `install.sh:11`  
**Issue:** Multiple concurrent installations could collide
```bash
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/claude-sdlc-$(date +%s)"
```
**Impact:** File corruption, installation failures  
**Fix:** Use atomic creation: `TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d "/tmp/claude-sdlc-XXXXXX")`

### 3. Inadequate Error Handling - **HIGH**
**File:** `install.sh:6,227-229`  
**Issue:** `set -e` with cleanup only at end, no trap handlers
**Impact:** Temporary files left behind on failures, inconsistent state  
**Fix:** Implement proper trap handlers for cleanup on EXIT/ERR/INT

## High Priority Issues

### 4. MCP Configuration Overwrite Risk - **HIGH**
**File:** `install.sh:144-145`  
**Issue:** Custom MCP configurations are overwritten in UPDATE_MODE without backup
```bash
if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json" ]] || [[ "$UPDATE_MODE" == true ]]; then
  execute "cp \"$TEMP_DIR/.mcp.json\" \"$PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json\""
```
**Impact:** Loss of custom MCP server configurations  
**Recommendation:** Create backup before overwriting: `cp "$PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json" "$PROJECT_DIR/.mcp.json.backup"`

### 5. No Network Failure Handling - **HIGH**
**File:** `install.sh:102`  
**Issue:** No timeout, retry, or validation for git clone operations
**Impact:** Unpredictable failures in poor network conditions  
**Fix:** Add timeout and retry logic with proper error handling

### 6. Missing Pre-flight Validation - **HIGH**
**File:** `install.sh:74-87`  
**Issue:** Limited validation of environment, permissions, and disk space
**Impact:** Cryptic failures during installation  
**Fix:** Comprehensive pre-flight checks for permissions, disk space, required commands

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Command File Overwrite Without Warning - **MEDIUM**
**File:** `install.sh:139`  
**Issue:** Custom command files are overwritten without warning
**Impact:** Loss of custom workflow commands  
**Recommendation:** Add warning message or backup mechanism

### 8. Directory Structure Scalability - **MEDIUM**
**File:** `install.sh:112-119,154-225`  
**Issue:** Hardcoded directory creation requiring 3 update points for new commands
**Impact:** High maintenance burden, version compatibility issues  
**Fix:** Implement configuration-driven directory creation

### 9. No Concurrent Installation Prevention - **MEDIUM**
**File:** `install.sh` (missing)  
**Issue:** No mechanism to prevent multiple simultaneous installations
**Impact:** File corruption, inconsistent state  
**Fix:** Implement project-level locking

### 10. Incomplete Repository Validation - **MEDIUM**
**File:** `install.sh:79-87`  
**Issue:** Only checks if `.git` directory exists, no health validation
**Impact:** Failures with corrupted git repositories  
**Fix:** Validate git repository health with `git status`

## File Preservation Analysis

### ✅ **SAFE - User Data Preservation**
All user-created files are properly preserved:
- **Feature task lists** (`.claude-sdlc/features/`)
- **Architecture docs** (`.claude-sdlc/architecture/`)
- **Build reports** (`.claude-sdlc/builds/`)
- **Review reports** (`.claude-sdlc/reviews/`)
- **Performance reports** (`.claude-sdlc/performance/`)
- **Fix reports** (`.claude-sdlc/fixes/`)
- **Ideas** (`.claude-sdlc/ideas/`)

### ✅ **SAFE - README File Protection**
README files are protected with explicit conditional checks:
```bash
if [[ ! -f "$PROJECT_DIR/.claude-sdlc/features/README.md" ]]; then
  # Create only if doesn't exist
fi
```

### ⚠️ **AT RISK - Configuration Files**
- **MCP configuration** (`.mcp.json`): Overwritten in UPDATE_MODE
- **Custom commands** (`.claude/commands/*.md`): Always overwritten

## Directory Structure Management

### Current Approach
- Uses `mkdir -p` for safe directory creation (preserves existing content)
- Hardcoded list of 8 directories with individual README creation
- Requires updates in 3 locations when adding new commands

### Extensibility Issues
- **High maintenance burden**: Each new command requires 3 code changes
- **Version compatibility**: Older scripts won't create directories for newer commands
- **No cleanup mechanism**: Deprecated directories remain indefinitely

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Configuration-driven approach** with directory metadata
2. **Loop-based creation** instead of hardcoded commands
3. **External configuration file** for directory definitions
4. **Command-based directory detection** from available commands

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- ❌ **Code injection vulnerability** through `eval`
- ❌ **Race conditions** in temporary directory creation
- ❌ **No input validation** for user-provided paths
- ❌ **No repository integrity verification**

### Recommendations
1. **Remove eval usage** - replace with direct command execution
2. **Use mktemp** for atomic temporary directory creation
3. **Add path validation** to prevent directory traversal
4. **Implement repository integrity checks** for expected files
5. **Add comprehensive logging** for security audit trails

## Update Safety Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical/High Priority)
1. **Fix code injection vulnerability** by removing `eval`
2. **Implement trap handlers** for proper cleanup on failures
3. **Use atomic temporary directory creation** with `mktemp`
4. **Add MCP configuration backup** before overwriting
5. **Implement network failure handling** with timeout and retry

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Add comprehensive pre-flight validation**
2. **Implement project-level locking** to prevent concurrent installations
3. **Refactor directory structure** to be configuration-driven
4. **Add rollback capability** for failed installations
5. **Enhance logging and debugging** capabilities

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Create installation state tracking** for partial failure recovery
2. **Add version compatibility checks** for smooth upgrades
3. **Implement automated testing** for installation script
4. **Add support for custom directory structures** per project type

## Testing Recommendations

### Required Tests
- **Concurrent installation handling**
- **Network failure scenarios**
- **Partial failure recovery**
- **Update from various previous versions**
- **Permission and disk space edge cases**

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test installation safety
bash install.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Test update mechanism
bash install.sh --update --dry-run

# Test error handling
bash install.sh --dir /non-existent/path

# Test concurrent execution
bash install.sh & bash install.sh
```

## Conclusion

The install.sh script's **file preservation mechanism works correctly** for user data, ensuring that existing features, builds, reviews, and other work products are never lost during updates. However, the script has **critical security vulnerabilities** and **operational robustness issues** that must be addressed.

**For your specific concern about file preservation during updates:**
- ✅ **User files are safe** - all work products in `.claude-sdlc/` subdirectories are preserved
- ✅ **New folders are added safely** - `mkdir -p` creates new directories without affecting existing content
- ⚠️ **Configuration files have overwrite risk** - `.mcp.json` needs backup strategy
- ⚠️ **Custom commands are overwritten** - should warn users or implement backup

**Priority actions for production readiness:**
1. Fix the code injection vulnerability (line 69)
2. Implement proper error handling with trap handlers
3. Add MCP configuration backup mechanism
4. Use atomic temporary directory creation

The script achieves its core goal of preserving user data during updates but needs security and robustness improvements before broader deployment.
