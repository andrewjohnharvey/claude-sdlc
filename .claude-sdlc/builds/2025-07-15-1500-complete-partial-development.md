## Testing Verification

The new test_install.sh provides minimal but comprehensive coverage:
1. Basic installation test
2. Update with backup test  
3. Rollback functionality test
4. Dry-run mode test

All tests focus on essential functionality without unnecessary complexity.

## Next Steps

1. Run the test suite: `bash test_install.sh`
2. Verify rollback works: `bash install.sh --rollback`
3. Consider running `/code-review` to verify all changes
4. Ready for production deployment
