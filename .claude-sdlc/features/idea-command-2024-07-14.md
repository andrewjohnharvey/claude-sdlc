# Feature: Idea Command

**Feature Identifier**: idea-command  
**Created**: 2024-07-14  
**Priority**: High - Critical for tool adoption

## Feature Summary

Create a new `/idea` command for claude-sdlc that allows users to quickly capture development ideas during their workflow. This command enables brain dumps without breaking development flow, storing ideas as markdown files in `.claude-sdlc/ideas/` for later reference and potential promotion to features.

## Goals

- Provide frictionless idea capture during development workflow
- Follow existing claude-sdlc command patterns and architecture
- Enable seamless transition from idea to feature planning
- Maintain simplicity to encourage adoption

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a developer working on my codebase**, I want to quickly capture ideas that pop into my head without breaking my current workflow, so that I can continue focusing on my current task while ensuring good ideas aren't lost.

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a team lead**, I want to capture feature ideas during meetings so they're stored in the project context
- **As a product manager**, I want to document requirements ideas in the same workflow as development
- **As any project contributor**, I want to suggest enhancements and have them stored systematically

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/idea` command accepts arguments like `/idea user-authentication-improvements`
- [x] Command asks ONE round of focused questions about intent, problem, and beneficiaries
- [x] Ideas are stored as markdown files in `.claude-sdlc/ideas/` directory
- [x] Files include timestamps in filename to avoid conflicts
- [x] Command follows same architecture patterns as existing commands
- [x] End prompt directs user to `/create-feature <idea-name>` for next steps
- [x] No editing, browsing, or complex workflow features
- [x] Integration with existing install.sh script

## Development Tasks

### Planning & Setup
- [x] Research existing command structure and patterns
- [x] Design single-round question flow for idea capture
- [x] Define idea file template and structure

### Implementation
- [x] Create `/idea` command markdown file in commands/ directory
- [x] Implement argument parsing following existing patterns
- [x] Create single-round question flow focusing on:
  - Intent/goal of the idea
  - Problem it solves
  - Who would benefit most
- [x] Configure file output to `.claude-sdlc/ideas/` with timestamp
- [x] Add end prompt directing to `/create-feature <idea-name>`
- [x] Follow existing command boundaries (no implementation, just planning)

### Integration
- [x] Update install.sh to create `.claude-sdlc/ideas/` directory
- [x] Add ideas directory README similar to other directories
- [x] Ensure command follows existing error handling patterns
- [x] Test command integration with existing claude-sdlc structure

### Testing & Documentation
- [x] Test `/idea` command with various argument patterns
- [x] Verify file creation and timestamp handling
- [x] Test workflow from `/idea` to `/create-feature`
- [x] Update project documentation as needed

## Technical Notes

- Follow exact same architecture as `/create-feature` but with simplified question flow
- Use existing file naming conventions with timestamps
- Maintain same markdown structure and formatting
- Keep consistent with existing command patterns and boundaries
- No complex features - focus on simplicity for adoption

## Integration Points

- **File System**: `.claude-sdlc/ideas/` directory creation
- **Command Flow**: Integration with `/create-feature` for idea promotion
- **Install Script**: Directory structure creation in install.sh
- **Architecture**: Consistent with existing command patterns
