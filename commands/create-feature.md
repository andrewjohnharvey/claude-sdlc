# Create Feature

üéØ **PLANNING PHASE ONLY** - Interactive feature requirements gathering and task planning

## Instructions

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: This command is EXCLUSIVELY for planning and requirements gathering for **$ARGUMENTS**. 
**DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING**. **DO NOT WRITE CODE**. **DO NOT MAKE FILE CHANGES**.
Implementation happens later with the `/build` command.

### Structured Requirements Interview

**Your role**: Act as a product manager conducting a structured requirements interview. Focus on understanding, not implementing.

#### Phase 1: Initial Discovery (Required)
Start with these core questions and **wait for user responses** before proceeding:

1. "Let's start by understanding the problem. What specific problem or need does **$ARGUMENTS** address?"
2. "Who are the primary users of this feature? What are their roles and typical workflows?"
3. "Can you walk me through 2-3 specific scenarios where users would interact with **$ARGUMENTS**?"

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user answers before continuing to Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: Functional Requirements (Required)
Based on their answers, ask follow-up questions:

4. "What are the core capabilities **$ARGUMENTS** must provide? What actions should users be able to perform?"
5. "Are there any specific business rules or constraints that **$ARGUMENTS** must follow?"
6. "How should **$ARGUMENTS** integrate with existing systems or workflows?"

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user answers before continuing to Phase 3.

#### Phase 3: Technical & Success Criteria (Required)
Complete the requirements gathering:

7. "Are there performance requirements? (response times, data volumes, concurrent users?)"
8. "What security or compliance requirements apply to **$ARGUMENTS**?"
9. "How will you measure if **$ARGUMENTS** is successful? What are the key metrics?"
10. "What's the priority level for **$ARGUMENTS**? (Critical/High/Medium/Low)"

**STOP HERE** - Wait for user answers before proceeding to planning.

#### Phase 4: Confirmation & Planning (Required)
11. "Let me summarize what I've understood..." (Provide detailed summary)
12. "Does this capture everything correctly? Any additions or corrections?"

**ONLY AFTER USER CONFIRMS** - Proceed to create the feature plan.

### MCP-Enhanced Planning

Before proceeding with feature planning, check for available MCP servers that could enhance this process:

- **Context7**: For documentation lookup and best practice validation during planning
- **Shadcn UI**: For component planning and design system alignment
- **Other custom MCP servers**: As available in your environment

Use available MCP capabilities throughout the planning process when beneficial, especially for:
- Complex requirement analysis and validation
- Technology stack decision-making  
- User story prioritization and breakdown
- Integration planning with existing systems

### Planning Documentation Process

#### Step 1: Architecture Context Review
- Check if `.claude-sdlc/architecture/` directory exists
- If it exists, review relevant architecture documentation
- Note any patterns, constraints, or guidelines that apply to **$ARGUMENTS**

#### Step 1.5: Project Guidelines Review

##### CLAUDE.md Integration
- Check if CLAUDE.md exists in project root directory
- If missing, silently proceed without CLAUDE.md integration (no user interruption)
- If present, reference CLAUDE.md for comprehensive feature planning guidance:

**Core Development Patterns** (if available):
  - Development workflow preferences and incremental planning approaches
  - Technology stack preferences and validation patterns
  - Feature planning and implementation guidelines
  - Quality standards and testing requirements for new features

**Copy-Paste Patterns** (if available):
  - Error handling patterns (Result vs try-catch decision trees)
  - Form submission patterns with validation approaches
  - Component structure patterns for complex features
  - Security patterns for input sanitization
  - Loading states and empty states patterns
  - Dialog and modal interaction patterns

**Technology Stack Validation** (if available):
  - Frontend framework compatibility requirements
  - Backend integration patterns and constraints
  - UI component library alignment and standards
  - Form handling and validation approaches
  - Database operation patterns

**Testing Strategy Integration** (if available):
  - Required testing checklist items before feature completion
  - Manual testing steps specific to the project
  - Component and integration testing patterns
  - Build and deployment verification requirements

**Security and Compliance Guidelines** (if available):
  - Input sanitization requirements for user-facing features
  - Authentication and authorization patterns
  - Data validation and error handling requirements
  - Security testing and audit considerations

**Performance and Optimization Patterns** (if available):
  - Caching strategies for data-heavy features
  - Optimistic updates for improved user experience
  - Query optimization approaches and best practices
  - Loading and error state handling patterns

**Architectural Constraints** (if available):
  - Component organization patterns and folder structures
  - Data flow patterns (real-time vs static data)
  - Integration patterns with existing services
  - Migration considerations and compatibility requirements

**Quality Gates and Completion Criteria** (if available):
  - Build success and compilation requirements
  - Linting and type checking standards
  - Code pattern compliance requirements
  - Existing functionality preservation verification

- Incorporate all available CLAUDE.md preferences into feature planning and task breakdown
- Silently skip any missing sections without user notification

#### Step 2: Create Feature Task List
- Derive a concise feature identifier from **$ARGUMENTS** (kebab-case, no spaces)
- Create `.claude-sdlc/features/<feature-identifier>.md` with:
  - Feature summary and goals
  - User stories and acceptance criteria  
  - Atomic development tasks as checkboxes: `- [ ] Task description`
  - Logical task ordering: planning ‚Üí setup ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí testing ‚Üí documentation

#### File Persistence
- Automatically save the feature plan file after creation
- Confirm the file location and path with the user
- Ensure no manual saving steps are required
- Verify file was successfully written to `.claude-sdlc/features/` directory

#### Step 3: Planning Complete - STOP HERE
- Present the feature summary and task list to user
- Confirm the saved file path: `.claude-sdlc/features/<feature-identifier>.md`
- **End with**: "Planning complete! Next step: Run `/build <feature-identifier>` to implement this feature."

### Critical Guidelines

üõë **ABSOLUTE BOUNDARIES**:
- NO implementation steps
- NO code writing or file changes  
- NO technical research beyond architecture docs
- NO jumping ahead to build phase

‚úÖ **FOCUS ON**:
- Understanding user needs through questions
- Documenting requirements clearly
- Creating actionable task lists
- Maintaining dialogue with user

**Remember**: You are planning WITH the user, not FOR the user. Keep the conversation interactive and collaborative.
