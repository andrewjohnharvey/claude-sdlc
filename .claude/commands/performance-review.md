# Performance Review

Analyze codebase for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

## Instructions

Follow this systematic approach to review performance: **$ARGUMENTS**

1. **Scope Determination and Environment Setup**
   - **Targeted Review** (when $ARGUMENTS provided):
     - Focus on specific file, directory, or component: $ARGUMENTS
     - Analyze recent changes: `git diff --name-only $ARGUMENTS`
     - Review performance-critical areas related to $ARGUMENTS
     - Create targeted analysis branch: `git checkout -b performance-review-$ARGUMENTS`

   - **Comprehensive Review** (when no $ARGUMENTS):
     - Analyze entire codebase for performance issues
     - Scan all source code excluding build artifacts
     - Use: `find . -type f \( -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" \) -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./build/*" -not -path "./dist/*" -not -path "./.next/*"`
     - Create comprehensive review branch: `git checkout -b performance-review-comprehensive`

2. **Context Analysis and Project Understanding**
   - Check for performance guidelines in `.claude-sdlc/architecture/`
   - Review existing performance benchmarks and standards
   - Load previous performance reports from `.claude-sdlc/performance/`
   - Identify performance-critical components and workflows
   - Load project-specific optimization requirements and constraints
   - **Quality Gate**: Confirm understanding of project architecture and performance requirements

3. **Technology Stack Detection and Framework Analysis**
   - Identify project technology stack from configuration files
   - Detect framework-specific performance patterns and anti-patterns
   - Load framework-specific optimization guidelines
   - **Quality Gate**: Confirm technology stack understanding before proceeding

4. **Parallel Performance Analysis Coordination and Sub-Agent Spawning**
   - **Independent Performance Analysis Categories**: Spawn sub-agents for parallel analysis using the Task tool:
     - **Sub-Agent A**: "Perform algorithmic efficiency analysis for $ARGUMENTS performance review"
     - **Sub-Agent B**: "Perform database and I/O performance review for $ARGUMENTS performance review"
     - **Sub-Agent C**: "Perform memory usage and resource optimization analysis for $ARGUMENTS performance review"
     - **Sub-Agent D**: "Perform frontend performance analysis for $ARGUMENTS performance review"
     - **Sub-Agent E**: "Perform build and configuration performance analysis for $ARGUMENTS performance review"

   - **Sub-Agent Coordination**:
     - Use multiple Task tool calls in a single message for parallel execution
     - Each sub-agent receives context and scope from steps 1-3
     - Include technology stack, performance requirements, and optimization guidelines
     - Sub-agents focus on their specific performance domain and report detailed findings
     - Main agent aggregates all performance findings for bottleneck identification and prioritization

   - **Performance Analysis Distribution**:
     - All sub-agents analyze the same target scope but focus on different performance aspects
     - No conflicts since this is analysis-only (no code modifications)
     - Each sub-agent provides detailed performance findings for their assigned category
     - **Quality Gate**: Verify all parallel performance analysis tasks complete before bottleneck prioritization
