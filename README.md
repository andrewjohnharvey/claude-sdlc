## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through using Claude-SDLC to add a feature to an existing TypeScript project.

### Prerequisites

- An existing TypeScript project
- Claude Code installed and configured
- Claude-SDLC installed (see installation instructions above)

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Plan your feature** using the `/create-feature` command:

#### In Claude Code, run:
```bash
/create-feature user-authentication
```

This will:
- Analyze your project structure
- Create a detailed task list for implementing user authentication
- Save the plan to `.claude-sdlc/features/user-authentication.md`

2. **Review the generated plan** in `.claude-sdlc/features/user-authentication.md`

3. **Implement the feature** using the `/build` command:

#### In Claude Code, run:
```bash
/build user-authentication
```

This will:
- Execute each task in the feature plan
- Generate TypeScript code following project conventions
- Create necessary components, services, and tests
- Mark tasks as completed as they're finished

4. **Review the implementation** and make any necessary adjustments

5. **Verify quality** with built-in review commands:

##### Run a comprehensive code review
```bash
/code-review
```

##### Check for security issues
```bash
/security-audit
```

##### Analyze performance
```bash
/performance-review
```

##### Generate additional tests if needed
```bash
/generate-tests user-authentication --run-tests
```

### Example: Adding a User Profile Feature

Let's say you want to add a user profile feature to your TypeScript application:

1. **Plan the feature**: Run `/create-feature user-profile`
   - Claude-SDLC will generate a comprehensive plan with tasks like:
     - Create user profile interface and types
     - Implement profile service with API integration
     - Add profile component with form validation
     - Create API endpoints with proper authentication
     - Write unit and integration tests
     - Update documentation

2. **Implement the feature**: Run `/build user-profile`
   - Executes each task in the checklist
   - Pauses if any errors occur for your review
   - Generates a detailed build report

3. **Quality assurance**: Run comprehensive reviews
   ```bash
   /code-review src/profile/          # Review the new profile code
   /security-audit src/profile/       # Check for security issues
   /performance-review src/profile/   # Analyze performance impact
   ```

4. **Generate additional tests if needed**:
   ```bash
   /generate-tests src/profile/ --run-tests --coverage-target=90
   ```

5. **Fix any issues found**:
   ```bash
   /fix-issues profile-validation-bug
   ```

That's it! You've successfully added a new feature to your TypeScript project using Claude-SDLC with comprehensive quality assurance.
